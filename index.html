     I am a final year engineering  student with electronics as my branch.
      i enjoy learning new things and web development is one of the inclinations i have,
      with the help of tanay's youtube videos i am able to build my first portfolio.
      some of my hobbies include- playing football, calisthenics and  body flow and playing valorant with my friends.
       my all time favourite movies include fightclub,rockstar, pursuit of happiness and life of pi.

      looking forward for more and more people to visit the website and review it for me to
